It is denoted by the symbol \"Σ\" (sigma) and is used to express the total sum of a series of terms. The general form of a summation is:\n\n$\\sum_{n=1}^{k} f(n)$\n\nHere, $n$ is the index variable that takes on values from 1 to $k$ and $f(n)$ is the function that defines the terms to be summed. The summation symbol indicates that we need to add up all the terms in the series for each value of $n$.\n\n**Example of Summation:**\n\nLet's consider the following example of a simple summation:\n\n$\\sum_{n=1}^{5} n$\n\nThis summation represents adding up all the integers from 1 to 5:\n\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15\n\n**Implementing Summations in Python:**\n\nIn Python, you can use loops to implement summations. The `for` loop is commonly used to iterate through a range of values and accumulate the sum.\n\n**Example of Summation in Python:**\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Calculate the summation Σ (n = 1 to 5) n\ntotal_sum = 0\nfor n in range(1, 6):\n    total_sum += n\n\nprint(total_sum)  # Output: 15\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n15\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n",
