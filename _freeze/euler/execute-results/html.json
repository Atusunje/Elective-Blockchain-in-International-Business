It might sound abstract, but it plays a vital role in mathematics, particularly when dealing with exponential growth or decay, and in concepts of continuous compounding in finance.\n\nThe natural logarithm, usually represented as $\\ln$, is the logarithm to the base $e$. It's fundamental in various fields, from solving exponential equations to analyzing exponential growth or decay patterns in data science.\n\n**Euler's Number (**$e$)\n\nEuler's number arises naturally in many areas of mathematics. For instance, consider money that is being continuously compounded. If you were to compound \\$1 at 100% interest over a year, but compound more frequently (daily, hourly, every second, and so on), the amount you'd have with continuous compounding is $e$ dollars.\n\n**Natural Logarithm (**$\\ln$)\n\nThe natural logarithm is the inverse operation to exponentiation with base $e$. In other words, if $y = e^x$, then $x = \\ln(y)$.\n\n**Why are they Important?**\n\n1.  **Continuous Growth/Decay:** Exponential growth or decay that happens continuously (like population growth or radioactive decay) can be described using Euler's number.\n2.  **Finance:** In business, the concept of continuous compounding is rooted in $e$.\n3.  **Data Analysis:** The natural logarithm helps in linearizing exponential growth data, making it easier to analyze and model.\n\n**Code Example in Python**\n\nLet's look at a real-world scenario:\n\nImagine a startup company's user base grows continuously. In its initial stages, the number of users doubled every year. We can model this growth with the equation: $N(t) = N_0 \\times e^{kt}$ Where:\n\n-   $N(t)$ is the number of users after time $t$.\n-   $N_0$ is the initial number of users.\n-   $k$ is the growth constant.\n\nGiven that the users doubled every year, we can determine $k$.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given values\nN_0 = 100  # Initial number of users\nN_t = 200  # Number of users after 1 year\n\n# Finding k using natural logarithm\nk = np.log(N_t/N_0)\n\nprint(f\"With growth constant k = {k} the number of users after 2 years = 100*e^(k*2) = {100*np.exp(k*2)}\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nWith growth constant k = 0.6931471805599453 the number of users after 2 years = 100*e^(k*2) = 400.0\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nUsing this growth constant, a company can predict future user numbers and strategize its business operations accordingly.\n\n## Assignment {.unnumbered}\n\n**Basic:** Determine the derivative of $f(x) = e^x$ using Python (see [section](derivatives.html) on derivatives). Evaluate the derivative function $f'(x)$ at $x=1, 2\\  and\\  3$ and compare with the corresponding values of $f(x)$. Explain in a short video what you've noticed and elaborate.\n\n**Stretch:** Expand your video with a presentation of the most beautiful equation in mathematics.\n\n**Challenge:** Share your content online (e.g. Linkedin or Medium), gather feedback and write a reflection on it.\n\n",
