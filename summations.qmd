**Mathematical Concept of Summations:**

In mathematics, summation is a concept that represents the addition of a sequence of numbers or terms. It is denoted by the symbol "Σ" (sigma) and is used to express the total sum of a series of terms. The general form of a summation is:

$\sum_{n=1}^{k} f(n)$

Here, $n$ is the index variable that takes on values from 1 to $k$ and $f(n)$ is the function that defines the terms to be summed. The summation symbol indicates that we need to add up all the terms in the series for each value of $n$.

**Example of Summation:**

Let's consider the following example of a simple summation:

$\sum_{n=1}^{5} n$

This summation represents adding up all the integers from 1 to 5:

1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15

**Implementing Summations in Python:**

In Python, you can use loops to implement summations. The `for` loop is commonly used to iterate through a range of values and accumulate the sum.

**Example of Summation in Python:**

```{python}
# Calculate the summation Σ (n = 1 to 5) n
total_sum = 0
for n in range(1, 6):
    total_sum += n

print(total_sum)  # Output: 15
```
